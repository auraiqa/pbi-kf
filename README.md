ðŸ§ª Kimia Farma Analytics SQL Project
This project was built during my project-based internship at Rakamin Academy, focusing on generating a business-ready analytical table using raw transactional data from Kimia Farma. I wrote a SQL query (and also the notebook version) that joins four different datasets: transactions, branch data, product details, and inventory into a single unified table.

The query also performs calculated fields such as nett sales, estimated gross margin, and nett profit, based on pricing tiers and discount logic. This cleaned and enriched table can be used for further business insight generation and dashboarding purposes. Though simple, this project helped me practice translating business logic into SQL and working with relational data in a structured way.
